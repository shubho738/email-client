# Email Client Frontend Project

This application features an email list page that displays all emails sent to a user. When an email is selected, the screen splits into a dual-pane layout: 

- **Left Pane**: Shows the email list with the selected email highlighted.
- **Right Pane**: Displays the body of the selected email.

Key features include:

- **Favorite Emails**: Mark emails as favorites by selecting an email and clicking the "Mark as Favorite" button.
- **Email Status**: Distinguish between read and unread emails with different CSS styles.
- **Email Filtering**: Filter emails by favorites, read, and unread status.

This app is built without any third-party libraries.
